Difference Between EntitySet and EntityRef:
------------------------------------------
If the associated class is the many (child) side of a one-to-many relationship, 
the many class will be stored in a collection 
of the many classes, where the type of the collection is EntitySet , 
and T is the type of the many entity class. This collection 
will be a member variable of the one class. If the associated class is the one (parent) 
side of a one-to-many relationship, a 
reference to the one class will be stored in a variable of type EntityRef , 
where T is the type of the one class. 
This reference to the one class will be a member variable of the many class. 
therefore, EntityRef & EntitySet act one-to-Many relationship,EntitySet act 
the many in parent and EntityRef act as One in Child.
