Man i found something that i hope will work for you as well.

I have a form by the name of mdiAuthor. The Windowstate MUST be minimized in the design view




Code Block

'Load the form into a variable mdlAuthor as new form. I declared it publically 

'for various reasons

mdlAuthor = mdiAuthor


mdlAuthor.MdiParent = mdiMainParent

mdlAuthor.Show()


'Here i hide the thing. 

mdlAuthor.Visible = False

 

'As you can see i basically move it off screen

mdlAuthor.Top = 30

'I think this is in the see

mdlAuthor.Left = 3000


'Size it back

mdlAuthor.WindowState = FormWindowState.Normal


'Now this is interesting. I have been told in another post that this will halt the layout on the front. Needless to say, it did not work as advertised. 

mdlAuthor.SuspendLayout()


'Make it visible again while it is off screen.

mdlAuthor.Visible = True

'Move it into position

mdlAuthor.Left = 300


'This bit is a waste as well byt there you have it.

mdlAuthor.ResumeLayout()



And in my case bobs my uncle. Anyway i googled for something like four hours straight and some of the things i saw there hardly made sense and were in C too boot. This is as far as my own creative thinking goes.
Now i have like 50 forms to implement it on.
Anyway if any of you brainiacs found a better solution then please let me know.
I love mdi for the control they provide and as i load it in a variable i can dispose it when i am fed up with it
